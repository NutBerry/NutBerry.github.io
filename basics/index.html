# Contract deployment

...always happens on L-1 as usual.
You can use the same address of the deployed contract on L1 to interact with it on L2.
However, there is one caveat. If you use a constructor to initialize your contract like in the example below,
then you need to modify it a little bit.
That is, instead of using a 'constructor' use a public function like `init` below - that allows your contract to be initialised once.

Summary:
<li>Modify the contract to use a `init` function instead of `constructor`. The function name is not important.</li>
<li>Deploy the contract as usual on L1.</li>
<li>Use the contract address from the deployment on L2 to initialize and interact with your contract</li>
<li>That's it</li>

 contract Example {
  uint256 public foobar;
  address public owner;

  // instead of using a constructor...
  constructor (uint256 _a) public {
    foobar = _a;
    owner = msg.sender;
  }

  // you have to use a public function to initialize your contract
  // on L-2 or L-1 or both :)
  function init (uint256 _a) public {
    // only allowed to set once
    require(owner == address(0));

    foobar = _a;
    owner = msg.sender;
  }
}
